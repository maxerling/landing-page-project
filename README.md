Word list:

CTA = Call To Action

# Goal

Goal with this page was to create a more interactive and 'personal' website for https://mekanluft.se

## Philosophy Of Landing Pages

The first thing I decided to do was to get a better understanding of what a landing page main objective is.

The main take away I took from my resource was you wanna make it easy to access the 'main objectives', and don't clutter the website with different options. Important to have some kind of CTA.

### Inspecting The Website

After that I decided to inspect the website to get the key components:

* Services
* Contact us
* About us


### Inspecting Different Websites

I decided to inspect other websites to get a better understanding what could be added to the website, some key takeaways was:

* Comanpy collaboration

Reason: Show seriouness of the company, if you have the option always a good idea to show previous work. 

* FAQ section

Reason: Section that may be the deciding factor if the person decide to get help from the company. An easy way to get an answer without being     forced to contact and wait for an answer.


  

# Starting The Project

So I decided first to do everything off the cuff. Even though I was able to 'make out' all the key components, didn't really like the style or structure of the website (check picture below).

I decided to re-create the project with Figma combined with looking up tutorials to get a better understanding of styling (check link below).

I would say I'm overall happy with the end result. Of course improvements can be made.

### Final Take Aways

I'm most happy with the simple logo decide that I made, really feel like it encapsulate the company in a very simple way and how I made the main description into just a few words.

Probably would add functinality to 'Tj√§nster' were you can get a description of each service when you click on it. Evalute the color scheme and maybe change that, especially 'Kontakta Oss' which has 4 colors right now. 

Change 'Om Oss' by adding more content, something similar to the Figma description.

When it comes to future projects I'm planning on trying Bulma or Tailwind CSS to see if it will make the styling part easier and more coherent.

Overall I'm happy and proud of myself.
